# Python Exercises Repository
This repository contains Python exercises as part of the Python for Data Science course. Each exercise is implemented in an individual branch, showcasing different fundamental programming concepts in Python. The exercises include functions, list comprehension, and basic algorithms, focusing on both logical problem-solving and data manipulation.

Exercises
Exercise 1: FizzBuzz
Objective: Write a function that implements the FizzBuzz logic.

Function Definition: fizzbuzz(n)
Takes an integer n as a parameter.
Logic:
Prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3.
Prints "Buzz" for multiples of 5.
Prints "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5.
Prints the number itself for other numbers.
Execution:
Call the function for numbers from 1 to 20.
Exercise 2: Basic Data Filtering
Objective: Filter a list containing mixed data types.

Create a List: Create a list containing integers, strings, and floats.
Filter List: Use list comprehension to create a new list containing only integers.
Print Result: Output the filtered list of integers.
Exercise 3: Simple To-Do List
Objective: Create a simple to-do list using Python functions.

Create List: Initialize an empty list called todo_list.
Define Functions:
add_task(task) to add a task to the list.
show_tasks() to print all tasks in the list.
Exercise 4: Temperature Converter
Objective: Convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Define Function: celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)
Converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Output Results: Print the converted temperatures for 22째C, 46째C, 51째C, and 76째C.
